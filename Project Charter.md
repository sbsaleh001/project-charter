## 7. Preliminary Budget 

**This budget should assume a Scrum framework and should contain:**

The SAT PREDICTOR project is expected to incur several costs during its development and launch. The following is an estimate of the project's expenses:

- Personnel costs: $400,000 (salaries and benefits for project manager and team members)
- Cloud storage costs: $10,000 (annual subscription fees for cloud platform)
- Marketing and advertising costs: $100,000 (costs associated with promoting the application)
- Legal and regulatory compliance costs: $50,000 (costs associated with obtaining necessary licenses and ensuring compliance with regulations)
- Software and hardware costs: $20,000 (costs associated with purchasing necessary software and hardware for development)
- Miscellaneous expenses: $20,000 (costs associated with travel, training, and other expenses not included in the above categories)

Total estimated project cost: $600,000

<br/>

**The cost of personal per sprint (each one of you can decide on your own paychecks!)**

Let's say that there are three team members working on the SAT PREDICTOR project, and they have agreed to work on a two-week sprint. Each team member has the option to set their own pay rate for the sprint. Here is an example of how they might set their pay:

- Team Member A decides to set their pay rate at $50 per hour and estimates that they will work 60 hours during the two-week sprint. Therefore, their personal cost for the sprint
would be $3,000.
- Team Member B decides to set their pay rate at $60 per hour and estimates that they will work 80 hours during the two-week sprint. Therefore, their personal cost for the sprint would be $4,800.
- Team Member C decides to set their pay rate at $45 per hour and estimates that they will work 50 hours during the two-week sprint. Therefore, their personal cost for the sprint would be $2,250.

In this example, the total cost of personal per sprint would be the sum of the individual costs of each team member:
- $3,000 (Team Member A) + $4,800 (Team Member B) + $2,250 (Team Member C) = $10,050
So the total cost of personal per sprint for the SAT PREDICTOR project would be $10,050.

<br/>

**The fixed consts involved in this project (hosting, infrastructure, rent, etc)**

let's say that the SAT PREDICTOR project team consists of three members: a data scientist, a software developer, and a project manager. They have agreed to work on the project for four sprints, with each sprint lasting two weeks.
For the purpose of this example, let's assume that they have decided to pay themselves as follows:

- The data scientist has agreed to a rate of $100 per hour and estimates that they will work an average of 30 hours per week.
- The software developer has agreed to a rate of $90 per hour and estimates that they will work an average of 25 hours per week.
- The project manager has agreed to a rate of $80 per hour and estimates that they will work an average of 20 hours per week.

Based on these rates and estimates, the total cost of personal per sprint for the team would be:
- Data scientist: $100/hour x 30 hours/week x 2 weeks = $6,000 per sprint
- Software developer: $90/hour x 25 hours/week x 2 weeks = $4,500 per sprint
- Project manager: $80/hour x 20 hours/week x 2 weeks = $3,200 per sprint

Therefore, the total cost of personal per sprint for the team would be $13,700.

<br/>

**A contigency between 10 and 15%**

let's say the total estimated cost of the SAT PREDICTOR project is $100,000. To calculate a contingency between 10% and 15%, we would first find the midpoint between those two percentages:
(10% + 15%) / 2 = 12.5%
So, the contingency percentage we will use is 12.5%. To calculate the contingency amount, we would multiply the estimated cost by the contingency percentage:
$100,000 x 0.125 = $12,500
Therefore, the contingency amount for the SAT PREDICTOR project would be $12,500. This amount can be added to the total estimated cost to account for unexpected expenses that may arise during the project.
